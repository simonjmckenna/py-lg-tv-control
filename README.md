# py-lg-tv-control
Python Code for driving IP Interface for pre webos LG smart TV

The pytv.py file now provides a class to control the tv.

There is a *very* simple wrapper that tests the functionality - tv.py

All of the control codes published by LG are in the command_codes file

The code was derived from code by Martin Harizanov https://harizanov.com/2013/12/control-lg-smart-tv-over-the-internet-using-a-raspberry-pi/

With documentation from LG at http://developer.lgappstv.com/TV_HELP/index.jsp?topic=%2Flge.tvsdk.references.book%2Fhtml%2FUDAP%2FUDAP%2FAnnex

It's going to form the basis of some Alexa home automation work using a pi and flask ask, oh and improve my python skills.
